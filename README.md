# Rainbow Code Finance
Rainbow Code Finance is a next-generation DeFi protocol designed to bring diversified, automated, and transparent asset management to decentralizied finance. The platform introduces smart vaults that are pegged to baskets of underlying assets-empowering users to gain balanced exposure to multiple tokens through a single composable vault. Users can create their own vaults and completely costumize them for their needs. Vaults can be costumized by strategy, allocation parameters and risk profile—yet remains pegged to its corresponding token basket. This structure allows both retail and institutional users to deploy capital efficiently while maintaining diversified exposure and automated yield optimization. Every vault can be pusblished so other users can invest in user created vaults.

By combining modular vault architecture, on-chain transparency, and algorithmic index tracking, Rainbow Code Finance bridges the gap between passive investing and dynamic DeFi strategies—making diversified DeFi exposure simple, colorful, and powerful.
