# Rainbow Code Finance
Rainbow Code Finance is a next-generation DeFi protocol designed to bring diversified, automated, and transparent asset management to decentralized finance. The platform introduces smart vaults that are pegged to baskets of underlying assets—empowering users to gain balanced exposure to multiple tokens through a single, composable vault.

At the core of Rainbow Code Finance are its proprietary on-chain indices:

**Rainbow Index (RIX)**: A diversified market-weighted index tracking a curated basket of top digital assets, offering users broad exposure to the crypto ecosystem.

**Rainbow Yield Index (RYX)**: Focused on yield-bearing assets, RYX aggregates performance across DeFi yield opportunities for optimized, sustainable returns.

**Rainbow DeFi Index (RDFX)**: A specialized index representing leading DeFi protocols, giving users exposure to the evolving decentralized financial infrastructure.

Each vault in Rainbow Code Finance can be customized by strategy, allocation parameters, and risk profile—yet remains pegged to its corresponding token basket, ensuring transparency and consistent value correlation. This structure allows both retail and institutional users to deploy capital efficiently while maintaining diversified exposure and automated yield optimization.

By combining modular vault architecture, on-chain transparency, and algorithmic index tracking, Rainbow Code Finance bridges the gap between passive investing and dynamic DeFi strategies—making diversified DeFi exposure simple, colorful, and powerful.
